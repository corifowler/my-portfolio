<h2>Creating Change with Code</h2>

<p class="about-me">I'm Cori, a Front End Developer, a problem-solver, and a creator. I found my passion for writing code and creating web applications through working in Education. Learning Computer Science with students has shown me the endless possibilities of writing code and about expressing yourself with technology. My favorite part of coding is that there is never just one solution to a problem, but many. I enjoy collaborating with others, learning from others, and sharing what I know.</p>
